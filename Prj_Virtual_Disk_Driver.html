			<h1>Virtual Disk Driver</h1>

				<div id = "Content">
					<p>This was a project that was assigned to me in one of my CMPSC courses. The goal of the assignment
						was to create a driver for a disk memory device. The disk organized data into different sectors, and
						data could only be read/written to the current location of the disk read head. Thus to read or write
						to a specific location, the head must be moved. Additionally, the only way to communicate with the device was via 3 commands: read, write,
						and move. Each of these 3 function take several arguments for which sector on the disk and which block 
						within the sector
					</p>
					
					<p>Thus the goal of the driver was to abstract these low level details in order to have the power to build an
						application that uses the device with much less difficulty. This was one of my favorite assignments, and I 
						learned a lot about systems programming. The link to the project is below, and I encourage you to look at the 
						smsa_driver.c file. This is where the core of the project lies.
