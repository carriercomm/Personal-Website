			<h1>About Me</h1>

					<p>My name is Gabe Harms and I am currently attending Pennyslvannia State University as a senior. 
						I was born in Santa Barbara, CA in June of 1993. I spent most of my childhood in 
						southern Califiornia, living right outside of Los Angelos. At the age of about 10 my
						family moved to central Pennsylvania in order to be closer to family. During my teenage years
						I attended State College Area High School. Upon graduation of high school I started my college
						career at Penn State majoring in Computer Engineering.<p>
					
					<p>My interest in computer was sparked during high school when I found out how to fix several
						game consoles including PS3s and XBOXs. Ever since I first opened up a PS3 I have been completly
						facinated with technology. It led to a curiosity that drove me to want to learn as much as I 
						possibly could about computers. As a result I took my first programming and electrical class
						during high school. Craving more, I enrolled in Penn State's Computer Engineering program. 
					</p>
					
					<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Penn State learning a wide range of subjects within computer
						science and electrical engineering. At the end of my sophmore year, I took an internship in Salt 
						Lake City, UT with Northrop Grumman. During my time there, I was a Systems Engineer looking for 
						safety concerns with autonomous air vehicles. At the end of the summer, I was asked to work part 
						time during my fall semester at Penn State. Thus, I worked remotely during school, putting in about 
						20 hours per week. At the end of the fall semester I was offered another internship with a company
						local to state college called Videon Central Inc. Thus I started in the spring semester of my junior
						year as a hardware engineer. I worked again 20 hours per week, and my tasks ranged from schematic 
						design to testing. I worked through the summer and was again asked to continue working part time
						during the fall of my senior year 20 hours a week.
					</p>
					
					<p>My experiences, both academic and professional, have given me a very diversified background. I had the 
						opportunity to gain experience in hardware design at Videon Central, and have even passed my Electrical 
						and Computer Engineering FE exam. However, I also thoroughly enjoy designing software though. I have started
						many of my own projects in which I push myself to learn different languages and types of programming. I feel 
						competent in both object oriented and structural programming. Thus, now I am currently looking for full time
						positions in all types of fields, hardware or software.
