			<h1>Evil Hangman</h1>

				<div id = "Content">
					<p>Evil Hangman is evil because the computer puts off picking a word for as long as possible. 
						The computer starts off with a dictionary of words. As the user guesses letters the computer 
						narrows the list of words that are active, meaning words that could still be chosen. The 
						words in the active list all  have the same pattern as the "word" displayed to the user.
						A pattern consist of the letters that have been guessed correctly and the letters that have not 
						been guessed yet. For example, if the current pattern is "-e-e-" then the words "beget", "beret", 
						"bevel", "defer", "deter" and so forth would be in the list of active words. Those words "match" 
						the pattern. The "-" characters are wildcard characters and represent any character that has not been guessed yet.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the user guesses a letter the computer splits the current list of words into different families based
						on the letter the user just guessed and the resulting pattern of that letter in words from the current list. The 
						computer then picks a list of word from the various lists that have been created. If the computer is being "evil" 
						it picks the list of words that is largest as the new active list.
