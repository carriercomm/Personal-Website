			<h1>Door Lock</h1>

					<p>During my years spent in the college dorms, I found myself constantly fumbling with my keys
						everytime I needed to get in or out of my room. Sometimes I had books and many other things 
						in my hands which made handling keys difficult. That was the inspiration for this project. To 
						create a way to lock/unlock my door with ease. </p>
						
					<p>To achieve this goal I implemented a wireless door lock using an arduino, wireless transmitter/receiverk,
						and an actuator. The wireless transmitter on my key chain contained a button. When this button was pressed,
						the wireless received, behind the door, would set a GPIO line high. This line was connected to the arduino, and
						the arduino continuously checked the voltage of this wire. If it was high, the arduino software would process a
						"door state change"; meaning that it would lock the door if it was unlocked or unlock the door if it was locked.
						The arduino would do this by driving 2 wires connected to the actuator high or low. The actuator in turn would
						push the bolt forward, or pull it backwards. The software for this project can be found at the github link below:
