					<p>During my junior year I took a systems programming class. This was a class that taught us how to do very
						very low level development using linux. This was one of my favorite classes, and I learned alot very quickly
						including how to use vim, makefiles, gcc and gdb. At the end of the course we touched the topic of the socket
						API. It fascinated me how much power a simple API had. Thus, with my curiousity peaked, I wanted to see what I 
						could build with it. After a lot of development and dubugging I was able to create a web server that processes
						requests, and served static content. It was really rewarding seeing my web server be able to serve content to my
						friends mobile browsers. This project taught me alot about not only software development, but about the details 
						of internet communication as well. Check out the github link below for source code:
