					<p>This was assignment was a group project that we were assigned in our 
						Operating Systems class, however the brunt of the work was done by me. The goal of this program is to simulate a 
						file system with an interface identical to the linux command line.
						All commands such as mkdir, mvdir, cd, and others work just as if 
						you were navigating a file system on a command line.
					</p>

					<p>The file system is simulated by allocating a large fixed block of 
						memory to the program. The program then sets up the file descriptor
						and root directory at the beginning of this memory. All created 
						directories and files are added contiguously to this memory. 
					</p>
					
					<p>We chose to simulate a disk partition with the use of malloc on a char
						array. We chose a size of 40,000,000 bytes (about 40MB), and we split
						this up into blocks of size 5,000. The file system descriptor is at
						the beginning of the memory (char array), and it takes up 2 blocks.
						Directories each take up 1 block, and files take up 1 block for the
						descriptors, and as many extra blocks as they need for data.
					</p>
					
					<p>We implemented files, directories, and the file system descriptor with
						structs the contain all the information needed for each type. For
						example, directories contain: name, top level, subitems[], subitem 
						types, and subitem count.
					</p>
					
					<p>Whenever files or directories were created, removed, or edited, we
						had to make sure to apply the relevent changes to all of the
						directories and descriptors that would be affected. A link to the Github
						page of this project is provided below:
