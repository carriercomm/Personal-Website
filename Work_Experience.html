					<h2>Videon Central Inc.</h2>
					<p>I took the job with Videon in order to explore the hardware side of the industry. Still in school,
						I desired to broaden my work horizons, and figure out what I really enjoyed. Thus, I started with 
						Videon Jan, 2014 during my 6th semester at PSU. I begin working part time, 20hrs/wk in order to be
						better prepared for work in the summer. 
					</p>	
					<p>The best part about working at videon is that I got to do 
						so many different things. The work I was given at videon can be divided into two main
						groups: Schematic Design, and Testing. In the early stages of development of a project, 
						the schematics must be designed. My boss would give me a number of pages to design, and
						would then send me off to figure out how to do so. Design schematics requires a lot of 
						research as well as a lot of technical knowledge. This was one of my favorite things to 
						at videon because it required critical thinking and problem solving in order to complete.
						The testing work I did was performed once our schematics had been designed, and the board 
						had been manufactured. It was then my goal to make sure that the board behaved as desired. 
						This so called "Bring-Up" process took weeks to go through. If there was a voltage that wasn't
						correct, or a damaged component, I would use a soldering iron to remove or replace components until
						the issue was fixed.
					</p>
					<p>I really enjoyed the people at Videon. The culture is very relaxing and welcoming, so it was 
						easy to work with my co-workers. At the end of the summer semester I was asked to once again work
						part time during the school year. Thus I worked 20hrs/wk during the fall semester of my senior year. 
						And at the end of this semester I was again asked to come back during my final semester at PSU
					</p> <br></br>
					
					<h2>Northrop Grumman</h2>
					
					<p>At the end of my sophmore year at PSU, I was offered a summer internship at Northrop Grumman as a 
						Systems Engineer. This particular office of Northrop was located out in Salt Lake City, UT. It was 
						such a great opportunity to be able to go out and spend the summer working there.
					</p>
					<p>The office I worked at specialized on software safety. The majority of their work comes from being contracted
						by the army, navy, air force, etc. to make sure that the software in their air or ground vehicles is safe. To 
						be more specific, I was placed on a project working with an Autonomous Unmanned helicopter. This was a huge project,
						and in order to be a valuable member of the team, I had to learn everything about the helicopter. After all, how can
						you analyse something you know nothing about. I spent the first week with Northrop pouring through thousands of pages
						of documentation of the helicopter highlighting and taking notes the whole way through. It was one of the largest 
						technical challenges I had faced, but I pushed myself and learned a lot. In the coming weeks I would be added to the team,
						and begin analysing the software governing the actions and navigation of the helicopter.
					</p>
					
					<p>My work at Northrop taught me a lot about systems, communication protocols, good documentation, and most
						importantly team work. At the end of the summer I was asked to work remotely during the fall semester from
						Penn State. Thus, I worked 20hrs/wk while maintaining a full course load. I was asked again at the end of the 
						semester to work during the spring, but I decided to take the internship with Videon.
